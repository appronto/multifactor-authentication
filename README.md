## What is Multifactor Authentication?

Multi-factor authentication (MFA; also known as Two-factor authentication or 2FA, along with similar terms) is an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism: knowledge (something only the user knows), possession (something only the user has), and inherence (something only the user is). MFA protects the user from an unknown person trying to access their data such as personal ID details or financial assets.

A third-party authenticator (TPA) app enables two-factor authentication, usually by showing a randomly generated and constantly refreshing code to use for authentication.

## What is the problem we solve?

The available multifactor implementations in the Marketplace offer the user to enter the code from a SMS, E-mail or generated by an authenticator (Google) after the actual login (and creation of the user session). See the diagram below:

At a successful login and prior to entering an MFA code, the user already has a valid user session and access to the user&#39;s authorized pages, microflows etc. (but you cannot see them nor easy access them). This approach is only working when dynamic role assignment is done after a valid MFA code (which is not default Mendix functionality).

## What is the solution?

We build an MFA module that extends the Mendix LoginAction, documented at [https://apidocs.rnd.mendix.com/7/runtime/com/mendix/core/action/user/LoginAction.html](https://apidocs.rnd.mendix.com/7/runtime/com/mendix/core/action/user/LoginAction.html)
The MFA code is validated first and only then the module creates a user session which grants the user to access their pages, microflows etc.

At the point in time after login in the first step:

mx.data.get({ xpath:&quot;//System.User&quot;, callback:function(data){console.log(data);} })

still returns the anonymous User object:

## How did we prove that this module is secure?

Scenarios to cover:

- Default login via login.html for accounts with MFA disabled.
- Default login via widgets for accounts with MFA disabled.
- Default login for webservice and REST accounts.
- Login by a customized login.html with MFA enabled (login-with-mfa.html + login-mfa.js + Authenticator app code only. Not compatible code sent by SMS or E-mail).
- Login by default widgets but extended with ability to enter MFA code with MFA enabled.


## How easy to use is this module in your Mendix application?

Download the module from the Mendix Marketplace here:

**There are a few things to configure:**

After startup configuration:
1. Add ASU\_MFA Microflow in your After Startup.

2. Change SUB\_MFA\_UserDisabledCheck that it will call your logic to determine the logged in user needs to be multifactor authenticated. Add the new attributes **HasMFAenabled(Boolean)**and **LastLogin2FA (datetime)** on Account entity.

3. Add your method(s) of multifactor authentication in SUB\_ValidateMFAforUser:

3 samples available:

- Google authenticator connector
  - Module download: [https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/2948](https://marketplace.mendix.com/link/component/2948)
  - Google Play Store: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en)
  - Apple App store: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)
- SMS
  - Change SUB\_InformMFACodeForUser to send the SMS
  - Send a SMS with for example Twilio:
  - Try Twilio here: [http://appron.to/try-twilio](http://appron.to/try-twilio) and create API key on [https://www.twilio.com/console/project/settings](https://www.twilio.com/console/project/settings)
- Email verification with code to verify
  - Change SUB\_InformMFACodeForUser to send the e-mail
  - Use default Emailtemplate module or Sendgrid API for example to compose this e-mail to your user.

4. Add snippet SN\_MFA\_LoginPage to your login page

5. Add if applicable move the login-with-mfa.html and js/login-mfa.js from the resources directory to your theme directory to support login actions with MFA from these pages.

6. Set you constant EnabledMFA to true to get started!

**Keep in mind when upgrading the module from the Appstore in the future:**

It will break the login mechanism but you will be notified because by default an exception will raise when not (correctly) configured the module with your own MFA logic. Like this &quot;An error has occurred while handling the request: java.lang.Exception: Create code not yet implemented&quot;.

## What we learned

We preferred a non-persistent approach to keep track of the anonymous user login steps (first with login, second with MFA code). It turns out when the first attempt was successfully validated, in the second step when passing the MFA code, the context/relation to the previous anonymous session was delete. Therefore we could not correlate this to the first step.

As of the session is also a persistent entity and we managed to associate the tracking to this entity and using a persistent &#39;MFA&#39; object was ok.

**Advanced: java challenges:**

When extending LoginAction class and trying to set parameters from this class in our extended class, we found out it was not possible in combination of super.execute() method. We decided to use createSession. We already had validated the username and password in the first step and the MFA object can&#39;t be modified/created by the anonymous user (and is also checked twice).

We also wanted the module to be compatible via a login.html variant and the custom login-with-mfa.html. Therefore, it is necessary to send the MFA code together with your username and password. We need to pass this MFA code through the header because the payload was stripped by the Core LoginAction functionality.
